## What is OCCAM?

OCCAM is software that implements [Reconstructibility Analysis](what-is-reconstructibility-analysis.html). OCCAM combines data mining, machine learning, and statistical analysis in a unique way which lets a user quickly understand the structure of their data, evaluate many possible models, and compare those models under statistical and information-theoretic criteria. Once a model is selected, OCCAM will fit that model to the data, identifying a simplified representation of the data structure that still preserves its essential features, and allow the user to explore and understand variable relationships and make predictions.
